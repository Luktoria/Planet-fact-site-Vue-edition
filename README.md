## Overview

The challenge is to build an 8-page planet fact-site and make it look as close to the design as possible. Frontend Mentor provided design files and text-files for the challenge, and it was up to the developer to decide how to build the website, and what tools to use.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"
